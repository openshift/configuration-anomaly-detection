# Tekton Pipeline to Trigger CAD Tests

This directory contains the configuration for tekton pipelines that perform the cloud provider/infrastructure configuration checks as part of one Pipeline.

## Installation

**Note**: some commands may require cluster-admin. To get it consult your docs team

Install CAD by running the following commands:

### Add the pipelines operator
First, apply the subscription to the pipeline operator:

```console
oc apply -f tekton
```

### Configure secrets
see section at the bottom of `Tasks Secrets` to configure

### Deploy container image
the repo builds the binary to a container using [../Dockerfile](a container file). build it using

```console
docker build . -t ${IMAGE_LOCATION}
```
and deploy it to a location you want, then change the image in the [./task-cad-checks.yaml](./task-cad-checks.yaml) using [https://github.com/mikefarah/yq](yq)
```console
OVERRIDE_IMAGE=${IMAGE_LOCATION} yq --inplace '.spec.steps[].image=env(OVERRIDE_IMAGE)' task-cad-checks.yaml
```

### Deploy components
Wait a minute until it becomes available, then apply the rest:

```console
oc apply -f namespace/
oc apply -f .
```
**Note**: the resource [./pipeline-run.yaml](./pipeline-run.yaml) will not be created using `oc apply && oc delete` as it uses a `.metadata.generateName`, thus is only available to create using `oc create` as seen later on

The CRs are going to be created in the `configuration-anomaly-detection` namespace.

After applying the CRs, a Weblistner will be opened for triggering pipelines. F.e. http://el-pipeline-event-listener.configuration-anomaly-detection.svc.cluster.local:8080 on CRC.

## [Optional] exposing as a route

if you would like to expose the service via a route, you can run
```
oc create route edge --service=el-cad-event-listener
```

## Trigger a Pipeline Run

PipelineRuns can be started via the following post command:

```console
oc exec -it deploy/el-cad-event-listener -- curl -X POST -H 'X-Secret-Token: samplesecret' --connect-timeout 1 -v --data '{"event": {"data": {"id":"12312"}}}' http://el-cad-event-listener.configuration-anomaly-detection.svc.cluster.local:8080
```

or for more details, see [tekton's docs on the matter](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/tree/main/examples#invoking-the-triggers-locally)

The Pipeline expects to receive details of a pagerduty event as payload. See the webhook payload that is send by Pagerduty [here](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/ZG9jOjExMDI5NTkw-v3-overview#webhook-payload).


The logs of the last pipeline can be fetched with the command as long as the pods are still available:
the `tkn` tool is pulled from https://github.com/tektoncd/cli

```console
tkn pipelinerun logs -f -n configuration-anomaly-detection $(tkn pipelinerun list -n configuration-anomaly-detection -o name --limit 1 | cut -d "/" -f2)
```

The result of the last runs can be seen with:

```console
tkn pipelinerun list -n configuration-anomaly-detection 
```

The documentation for further Tekton commands is available [here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/cli_reference/tkn_cli/op-tkn-reference.html).

## What Do We Have Here
### Namesapce
straightforward, but [namespace.yaml](./namespace.yaml) holds all of the next resources
#### SA
[serviceaccount.yaml](./serviceaccount.yaml) holds the serviceaccount, role and clusterroles that are needed for the CAD resource
#### Trigger
[pipeline-trigger.yaml](./pipeline-trigger.yaml) holds all of the triggers and the base config that starts the pipeline
#### PipeLine
[pipeline.yaml](./pipeline.yaml) the order of the tasks that is triggered by [pipeline-trigger.yaml](./pipeline-trigger.yaml)
#### Tasks
[task-cad-checks.yaml](./task-cad-checks.yaml) is the actual task
##### Tasks Secrets
###### AWS
[task-cad-checks-secrets-aws.yaml](./task-cad-checks-secrets-aws.yaml) this will hold the AWS creds, and we have an env file [aws.env.sample](./aws.env.sample) for populating it

see [../pkg/aws/](../pkg/aws/) for more details

###### PagerDury
[task-cad-checks-secrets-pd.yaml](./task-cad-checks-secrets-pd.yaml) thiis will hold the pd creds
see [../pkg/pagerduty/](../pkg//pagerduty/) for more details

###### OCM
[task-cad-checks-secrets-ocm.yaml](./task-cad-checks-secrets-ocm.yaml) thiis will hold the ocm creds
see [../pkg/ocm/](../pkg/ocm/) for more details

#### PipelineRun
[pipeline-run.yaml](./pipeline-run.yaml) can trigger a pipeline
