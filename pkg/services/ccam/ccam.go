// Changing the templates' summaries will likely prevent CAD from removing clusters with these Limited Support reasons in the future, since it identifies which reasons to delete via their summaries.
// If the summaries *must* be modified, it's imperative that existing clusters w/ these LS reasons have the new summary applied to them (currently, the only way to do this is to delete the current
// reason & apply the new one). Failure to do so will result in orphan clusters that are not managed by CAD.
