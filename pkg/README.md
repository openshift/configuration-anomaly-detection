## Development

1. Add a new endpoint to cadctl.
   
    ```
    make bin/cobra
    cd ./cadctl
    ../bin/cobra add -a "Red Hat, Inc." -l apache test
    ```

2. Change the endpoint to include the code that needs to run with all of the required params.

3. Build `cadctl` (explained in the root README.md) and run `cadctl test`.
