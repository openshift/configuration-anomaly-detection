# Testing aiassisted Investigation

TODO:
- Add a test script or test objects to this  directory for future maintainers to use
- Edit this README file and add detailed instructions on how to use the script/objects to recreate the conditions for the investigation. Be sure to include any assumptions or prerequisites about the environment (disable hive syncsetting, etc)
