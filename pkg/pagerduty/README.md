# PagerDuty Package

Use the `pagerduty.NewWithToken` to create the PagerDuty client, and use the functions it has
[embedmd]:# (../../cadctl/cmd/investigate/investigate.go /\/\/ GetPDClient/ /^}$/)
```go
// GetPDClient will retrieve the PagerDuty from the 'pagerduty' package
func GetPDClient(webhookPayload []byte) (pagerduty.Client, error) {
	cadPD, hasCadPD := os.LookupEnv("CAD_PD_TOKEN")
	cadEscalationPolicy, hasCadEscalationPolicy := os.LookupEnv("CAD_ESCALATION_POLICY")
	cadSilentPolicy, hasCadSilentPolicy := os.LookupEnv("CAD_SILENT_POLICY")

	if !hasCadEscalationPolicy || !hasCadSilentPolicy || !hasCadPD {
		return pagerduty.Client{}, fmt.Errorf("one of the required envvars in the list '(CAD_ESCALATION_POLICY CAD_SILENT_POLICY CAP_PD_TOKEN)' is missing")
	}

	client, err := pagerduty.NewWithToken(cadEscalationPolicy, cadSilentPolicy, webhookPayload, cadPD)
	if err != nil {
		return pagerduty.Client{}, fmt.Errorf("could not initialize the client: %w", err)
	}

	return client, nil
}
```

## Make `cadctl` load PD creds

If you have `pagerduty-cli` installed, you can run the oneliner:

```
export CAD_PD_TOKEN=$(jq  .subdomains[].legacyToken ~/.config/pagerduty-cli/config.json -r) 
```
and the token will be used.

You can also load a token from the UI. Use the link to get a token, and bind it to the envvar https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/api-access-keys#generate-a-user-token-rest-api-key

## Create the secret 

* CAD_ESCALATION_POLICY: refers to the escalation policy CAD should use to escalate the incident to
* CAD_PD_EMAIL: refers  to the email for a login via mail/pw credentials
* CAD_PD_PW: refers to the password for a login via mail/pw credentials
* CAD_PD_TOKEN: refers to the generated private access token for token-based authentication
* CAD_PD_USERNAME: refers to the username in case username/pw credentials should be used
* CAD_SILENT_POLICY: refers to the silent policy CAD should use if the incident shall be silent
* PD_SIGNATURE: refers to the PagerDuty webhook signature (HMAC+SHA256)
* X_SECRET_TOKEN: refers to our custom Secret Token for authenticating against our pipeline


## Manually test on an incident

To do this, use the https://github.com/martindstone/pagerduty-cli tool.

1. Create the incident:

	```shell
	INCIDENT_TITLE= # the title you would want the incident to have
	SERVICE_ID= # the service under which the incident is created
	ESCALATION_POLICY_ID= # the escalation polict under which the incident is created (in case the default escalation policy will ping oncall
	pd incident:create --title=${INCIDENT_TITLE} --service_id=${SERVICE_ID} --escalation_policy_id=${ESCALATION_POLICY_ID}
	```

	The above command will output the incident's id.

2. Verify the incident has changed after running the `cadctl` change:

	```shell
	# for CLI data
	INCIDENT_ID= # the ID pulled from the previous command
	pd rest:get --endpoint /incidents/${INCIDENT_ID}
	# for the UI
	pd incident:open --ids ${INCIDENT_ID}
	```

3. Resolve the incident:

	```shell
	INCIDENT_ID= # the ID pulled from the create command
	pd incident:resolve --ids ${INCIDENT_ID}
	```

## Receiving PagerDuty Webhook Messages

### Manual Testing

1. Set up the WebHook.
   
   Created a webhook https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/webhooks#add-a-v3-webhook-subscription and attached it to a schedule.

2. Provide a http receiver for pushing the webhook data.

	Installed https://ngrok.com/ and started it with 
	```
	ngrok http 8080
	```
	which had a HTTP and HTTPS url to provide to PagerDuty.

	Disclaimer: **NGROK HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE SECURITY TEAM, DO NOT USE WITH PRODUCTION DATA** TODO: find a better alternative

3. Connect the HTTP receiver to a local port to receive the webhook data.
   
	Used `nc` to retrieve the data:

	```
	while true; do { echo -e 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n'; } | nc -l 8080; done
	```

	which also worked and printed the data to stdout.

4. Send a local payload instead of the webhook to test the flow.
   
	To test without PD you can send to the URL the following command

	```
	URL= # the URL from ngrok
	curl -XPOST -d'{}' ${URL}
	```

### Prettify the webhook data into organized YAML data
To parse the data in a pretty format:

1. Save all the JSON blobs in a YAML file.
   
2. Add them into a YAML array: 
     - Add a `items:` to the top of the file
     - Each JSON was prepended with `- ` (dash then a space)

3. Use https://github.com/mikefarah/yq to prettify the whole thing

	```
	FILE= # the file which the webhook JSON blobs that were transformed by the previous steps were saved
	yq -P ${FILE}
	```

4. Add a description to each event to make it usable for the next reader.

	See the titles with :
	```
	yq e .items[].description  parsed-by-yq-webhook-payloads-from-test-pagerduty.yaml
	```

	To pull a specific JSON blob (the first one in this example).
	```
	yq '.items[0] | del(.description)'  parsed-by-yq-webhook-payloads-from-test-pagerduty.yaml -ojson | jq > ../../payload.json
	```
